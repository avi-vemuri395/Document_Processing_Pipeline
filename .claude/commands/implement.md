Now, with the following in mind carefully execute the implementation plan above:

**Make sure to idenitfy and trace any potential breaking changes you make and any changes to highly reused code to determine whether breaking changes need to be addressed.
**Always check for dead code along the way and make sure to inform me of this after.
** Do not unnecessarily overengineer features or future proof without asking me first. The goal is to keep the implementation simple, while achieveing the intended functionality.
**Think deeply, and execute your implementation planned with a strategy that will allow you to perform the implementation task to your best abilities.
