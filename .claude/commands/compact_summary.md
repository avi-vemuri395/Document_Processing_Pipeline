# Compact With Predefined Summary Instruction

Run compaction using this summary specification to retain the most relevant context for continued debugging:

<summarize the current state of the implementation along with the current and end goal, any bug recent bug fixes and-or improvments, and issues we we still have to work through.
Feel free to include any other necessary context to further continue debugging this flow>

Now execute `/compact` with the above instruction so it guides the compaction.
