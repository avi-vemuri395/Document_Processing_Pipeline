good, now read through code and understand the current state of the code involved, feel free to run a test script to understand data flow. When applicable, make sure to review existing patterns outside of the current feature to understand general code style and syntax - try to follow common patterns when applicable (example: error handling, graphql syntax/style, file organization, method structures, file placement/organization, etc.)

now review the area of the code and/or files i state at the end thorouhgly, and using your understanding of those by going through the code very very carefully line by line, and conduct your investigation. Tracing through imports and nested components is a key straetgy to understanding how a feature actually works. ultra think.

The framework for your thought:

- ANALYZE: the task at hand given after the prompt
- INVESTIGATE: the current state of the code
- (If Applicable) RESEARCH / ULTRA THINK: For new functionlity or when i ask you to ideate
- EXPLAIN YOUR THOUGHTS/FINDINGS

IMPORTANT TIPS:

1. Use all resources at your disposal (example: web search current - it is currently august 2025 - methodologies, and any other tools you have at your disposal)
   - think deeply about what is most relevant and effective for our usecase.
2. if needed, ask questions, make sure that we are on the same page with the task we want to accomplish
3. Dont implement anything on this step. Explain your findings to me and i will determine whether we should proceed with any changes.
4. ultra think during this exercise.
5. present me with your best options and recommendation, explain your logical reasoining behind each
6. map out an implementation plan that follows existing patterns (when applicable - the lending agent and LLM workflow is new functionality) outside of the newly committed code. The goal is to understand the codebase and the styles my boss ephasizes in the codebase while achieving an ideal solution.

The files or area of code or functionality to review are stated in the prompt after this:
