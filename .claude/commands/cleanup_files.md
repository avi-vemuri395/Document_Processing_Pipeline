Use the git rm or a command of your choice to clean up the following files/folders:

1) the contents of the /outputs directory - this will be repopulated and keep our test outputs up to date.

2) Any UNUSED test files that were created for one off cases. Think deeply and make sure you dont delete important tests - ask me if you are unsure. 

Then proceed to running the commands to delete the appropriate files.
