# Implementation Summary - Two-Part Pipeline Architecture

## What Was Built

### 1. Architecture Design (`TWO_PART_PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- **Complete storage model** for incremental document processing
- **Two independent parts**:
  - Part 1: Document processing with all 9 templates → Master JSON
  - Part 2: Form mapping for 3 banks independently
- **State tracking** at multiple levels with audit trails
- **Conflict resolution** and validation layers

### 2. Multi-Template Processor (`src/template_extraction/multi_template_processor.py`)
- **Processes each document with ALL 9 templates** simultaneously
- **Merges extractions** into categorized master data:
  - personal_info, business_info, financial_data, tax_data, debt_data
- **Handles conflicts** using confidence scores
- **Independent Part 2** that maps master data to each bank's forms
- **Complete state management** with history tracking

### 3. Template Specifications (9 templates created)
- **Live Oak**: SBA Application, PFS, 4506-T (3 forms)
- **Huntington**: Business App, PFS, Tax Transcript, Debt Schedule (4 forms)
- **Wells Fargo**: Loan Application, Financial Statement (2 forms)

### 4. Test Suite (`test_two_part_pipeline.py`)
- Demonstrates complete two-part pipeline
- Shows incremental document processing
- Analyzes conflicts and state history
- Generates proper folder structure

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Storage Structure
```
applications/{app_id}/
├── part1_document_processing/
│   ├── extractions/per_document/{doc_id}/
│   │   └── {all 9 template results}.json
│   └── state/
│       ├── current.json (master data)
│       └── history/
└── part2_form_mapping/
    └── banks/{bank}/forms/{form}/
        ├── filled_form.json
        └── state.json
```

### Processing Flow
1. **Document Upload** → Extract with 9 templates
2. **Merge Results** → Resolve conflicts by confidence
3. **Update Master Data** → Categorized structure
4. **Map to Forms** → Independent per bank
5. **Generate PDFs** → Ready for submission

## Current State

### Working
- ✅ Multi-template extraction (9 templates per document)
- ✅ Master data merging with conflict tracking
- ✅ Two-part pipeline separation
- ✅ State management and history
- ✅ Bank-specific form mapping
- ✅ Test demonstrates full architecture

### Test Results
- **Part 1**: Extracted 18 fields across categories (3.8% coverage with template-based extraction)
- **Part 2**: Mapped to 3 banks with varying coverage
- **State**: Full audit trail with snapshots
- **Conflicts**: Automatic resolution by confidence

### Pending
- ⬜ LLM validation layer integration
- ⬜ Business rules validation engine
- ⬜ S3 integration for production
- ⬜ API endpoints
- ⬜ PDF generation for Part 2

## Migration Path

### To Production (TypeScript/S3)
```typescript
// Part 1: Document Processing
async function processDocument(appId: string, doc: File) {
  const extractions = await extractWithAllTemplates(doc);
  const masterData = mergeExtractions(extractions);
  await saveToS3(appId, 'part1', masterData);
}

// Part 2: Form Mapping (Independent)
async function mapToBankForms(appId: string, bank: string) {
  const masterData = await loadFromS3(appId, 'part1');
  const forms = mapToForms(masterData, bank);
  await saveToS3(appId, 'part2', bank, forms);
}
```

## Key Insights

1. **Approach B Confirmed**: Extract from each document with all templates, then merge
2. **Independence**: Part 1 and Part 2 can run completely independently
3. **State Tracking**: Both input data processing AND each form need separate state
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Confidence-based merging handles field conflicts automatically
5. **Scalability**: Architecture supports unlimited documents and incremental processing

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate LLM extraction** alongside template extraction for better coverage
2. **Add validation layers** for business rules and data quality
3. **Implement S3 storage** for production deployment
4. **Create API endpoints** for TypeScript integration
5. **Add PDF generation** to Part 2 for final output

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `TWO_PART_PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete architecture documentation
- `src/template_extraction/multi_template_processor.py` - Core implementation
- `test_two_part_pipeline.py` - Demonstration test
- 9 template specification files in `templates/form_specs/`

### Previous Work Preserved
- All Phase 3 implementation (table extraction, exporters)
- Incremental processing utilities
- Original orchestrator with `process_single_document()`

## Summary

Successfully designed and implemented a two-part pipeline that:
- Processes documents with all 9 templates simultaneously
- Creates categorized master data with conflict resolution  
- Maps master data to bank forms independently
- Maintains complete state tracking and audit trails
- Supports incremental document processing
- Provides clear migration path to production

The architecture addresses all requirements for processing loan applications across multiple banks with proper separation of concerns and state management.
